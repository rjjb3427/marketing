### Dilemma

Unlike at many other schools, which have walls and defined boundaries, NYU stands apart as unique. We face adverse conditions for marketing: a large, diverse, disperse student body with a lively city that distracts. 

### Method

- Build our marketing assets, such as the Digest and Twitter followers.
- Funds permitting, advertise on Facebook and Google constantly.
- Make a checklist for each initiative, and just go down the list. Time should be spent innovating (adding lasers to DemoDays, choosing sweet music for HackDays, etc.), not worrying about the basics

#### Media outlets (for bigger events)

- The folks at NYU Local are our friends (especially Myles Tanzer) <3
- The Washington Square News
- NYUEN: reach out to individual member clubs. Not many people forward news from the list
- Forbes (they have covered the Berkley Center's Entrepreneurs Challenge)
- Adrianne Jeffreys, at BetaBeat
- Professors and announcements in class (very high conversion rate)

#### Owned marketing channels

- Tech@NYU Digest
- Tech@NYU Twitter, member twitter network
- Facebook ads
- Google ads
- For giant events, email Marc Wais, VP of Student Affairs to get on the NYU Minute
